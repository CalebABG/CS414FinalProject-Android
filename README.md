# CS414FinalProject-Android
![](images/CS414FinalProjectApp.png?raw=true "In-app control activity screen capture. Activity has two control sections, one on the left which is vertically stacked with three inner CardView sections, and the other on the right which is also vertically stacked but wider, with two inner CardView sections. The top section allows for showing the phones accelerometer values as either raw or calculated values. The next section has three buttons: a shield, which enables or disables remote control of the car; an emergency stop button, which will stop the cars motors each time it's pressed; and a bluetooth connect button, which connects the phone to the bluetooth module of the Arduino. The second wider control section on the right is first composed of a CardView which has two input fields and a button. These fields allow for changing the cars drive parameters, and the button sets the parameters. The next section is composed of two text views, one for the title and the other for displaying the current number of recorded packets sent to the car; along with buttons for recording, stopping, saving and viewing packet replays.")

## Synopsis
This is the Android app code for my Android class final project. This code is the phone controller app that allows for controlling the movement of the car, setting drive parameters for the car, connecting to the Arduino's Bluetooth module, viewing the phone's Accelerometer data as raw or calculated values, and recording and saving in real-time packets from the phone to the Arduino, as well as movement playback from recorded packet Replays in real-time.
